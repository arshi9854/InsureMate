## üéØ **Interview Talking Points**

### **Technical Deep Dive**
- "I implemented an ensemble ML model that combines Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression with weighted voting based on cross-validation performance"
- "The application uses Redis caching to achieve 90% cache hit rates and sub-200ms API response times"
- "I designed a microservices architecture with Docker containers, enabling horizontal scaling and independent service deployment"

### **Business Impact**
- "This platform could help insurance companies reduce underwriting costs by 15% through more accurate risk assessment"
- "Individual users can potentially save $3,000-$15,000 annually by understanding their risk factors and making informed decisions"
- "The healthcare technology market is worth $350B+, making this a commercially viable solution"

### **Problem-Solving Approach**
- "I identified that smoking is the strongest predictor (45% feature importance) and designed the UI to highlight this insight"
- "To handle high traffic, I implemented connection pooling, caching, and async processing"
- "I used explainable AI techniques to provide transparent factor breakdowns, building user trust"
